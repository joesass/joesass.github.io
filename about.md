Hi, welcome to my blog. My name is Joe Sasson. 

I am a husband, father, and full stack software engineer working at [Marc Joseph New York](https://www.marcjosephnewyork.com/).

I love discovering how things work and figuring out elegant solutions to problems. 

I also love automating the simple tasks that we are all forced to do.

Learning and writing software affords me the opportunity to do both of those things, and that's why I love what I do!

Feel free to contact me about ideas, job opportunities, or just to chat about technology or anything else!
